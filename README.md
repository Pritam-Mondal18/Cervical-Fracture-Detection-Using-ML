# ðŸ§  Cervical-Fracture-Detection-Using-ML

## Overview

<p>This project focuses on detecting occult fractures in the cervical bones (C5) which is often missed by traditional CT scans. If left undiagnosed, this fracture can lead to serious long-term health issues, including immobility and spinal immobilization. By utilizing machine learning with advanced "Edge Detection" technology, this model provides a solution to accurately detect fractures, ensuring early diagnosis and timely intervention to improve patient outcomes.</p>
