# Cervical-Fracture-Detection-Using-ML

<p>Traditional CT scans often fail to detect occult fractures in cervical bones (C5, C6, C7), leading to delayed diagnosis and serious long-term health issues such as immobility and spinal complications. Our ML-based model leverages edge detection technology to enhance fracture detection, ensuring early diagnosis and timely intervention for better patient outcomes.</p>
<h3>FeaturesEarly Detection:</h3>
<ul><li>Identifies occult fractures that CT scans may miss.
Edge Detection Technology: Uses advanced ML algorithms for precise image analysis.
Improved Patient Care: Helps in timely diagnosis, reducing the risk of complications.</li></ul>
