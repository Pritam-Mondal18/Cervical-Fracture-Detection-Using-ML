# Cervical-Fracture-Detection-Using-ML

<p>This project focuses on detecting occult fractures in the cervical bones (C5, C6, C7), which are often missed by traditional CT scans. If left undiagnosed, these fractures can lead to serious long-term health issues, including immobility and spinal immobilization. By utilizing machine learning with advanced "Edge Detection" technology, this model provides a solution to accurately detect fractures, ensuring early diagnosis and timely intervention to improve patient outcomes.</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<b>Enhanced Detection:</b> Identifies fractures in cervical bones that CT scans may miss.
<b>Early Diagnosis:</b> Reduces the risk of prolonged undiagnosed conditions, preventing severe health complications.
<b>Edge Detection Technology:</b> Leverages ML to perform precise image analysis for accurate fracture identification.
This model aims to improve the accuracy of cervical fracture detection, contributing to better patient care and faster recovery.
