## Overview

<p>This project focuses on detecting occult fractures in the cervical bones (C5) which is often missed by traditional CT scans. If left undiagnosed, this fracture can lead to serious long-term health issues, including immobility and spinal immobilization. By utilizing machine learning with advanced "Edge Detection" technology, this model provides a solution to accurately detect fractures, ensuring early diagnosis and timely intervention to improve patient outcomes.</p>

## Table of Contents:
### Prerequisites:
<p>Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:</p>
<ul><li>Python: <a href="Download Python">Download Python</a></li></ul>

### Installation:
<ul><li><p>Clone or download this project to your local machine.</p></li>
<li>Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory using the cd command</li>
<li>Install the required libraries and dependencies using pip</li></ul>

### Usage:
<p>Once the project is set up, you can use the ML model to detect cervical fractures in CT scan images using edge detection.</p><br/>
<p>The model will output whether a fracture is detected in the cervical vertebrae.</p>

### Key Features:
<ul><li><b>Enhanced Detection:</b> Identifies fractures in cervical bones that CT scans may miss.<br/></li>
